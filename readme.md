# Fist of Jupiter

Classic arcade shoot-'em-up.
This is a bodge project, but I am absolutely capable of coding well.

## Releasing

Make `decodeScoreRecord` account for previous format of recorded scores, if applicable (if not applicable, do adjust any if/elseif blocks to include as appropriate).
Use `makelove` with version parameter set to next version (increment major or minor number as appropriate), and release the files.
