# Fist of Jupiter

Classic arcade shoot-'em-up.
This is a bodge project, but I am absolutely capable of coding well.

## Releasing

Make `decodeScoreRecord` account for new version of game and, if changed, the new score format.
Use `makelove` with version parameter set to next version (increment major or minor number as appropriate), and release the files.
