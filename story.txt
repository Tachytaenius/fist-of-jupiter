In the year 30XX, humanity has spread out across the solar system. There are multiple space stations around most of the planets.

The Jovian colonies have reached a form of political organisation that can only be described as utopian. But, the forces of Earth know that this would be a threat to their political domination, were it to spread. They have sent out a fleet to destroy the Jovian colonies, and with them, the threat of hope. The population of Earth are all brainwashed, and support the invasion. They can be radicalised once the fleet is defeated.

The greatest scientists and engineers of the Jovian colonies have worked tirelessly to build the greatest fighting machines they could, with what they had available. A small but brave retaliatory fleet of pilots with rushed training, all young and afraid to die, has been sent out to meet the invading forces of Earth.

You are the best of the pilots, and have been sent to defeat the commanding ships as the other pilots hold back the invasion.

You are the fist of Jupiter! Can you accomplish your mission and save humanity from another thousand years of darkness?
