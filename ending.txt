You have done it!

You have completed your mission! The flagship of the Earth invasion has been reduced from a towering monstrosity of terror to blackened wreckage floating in space. Earth's forces are scattered. The invasion is over.

With Earth's forces defeated, the way of the Jovian utopia has a chance to spread.

You are a hero! The hero of Jupiter, of humanity. This day will go down in history for many millennia to come.
