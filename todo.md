# Before release

- Ending where the player goes forwards and (relative to camera, so camera pos changes) moves to a point in the upper middle of the screen and then flies off as the camera stops(?).
- Add a recorded high score system with names that also records the version of the game. Allow starting on arbitrary waves. show wave start and end. replace 1 with "START", replace 20 with "BOSS". and replace end with "END" if the game was beaten. star for victory at boss, skull for death, door for quit. Default to showing scores starting on 1 but alloww changing category to other start waves. Save timestamp for scores in file. Show total number of scores saved in scores menu
- Balance score so that no factor dominates
